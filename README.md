## 1. Prerequisites & Setup

This script is designed for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems. Before running it, you must have the required tools installed.

1. **Update your package list:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install required packages:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y default-jdk curl wget jq unzip procps
   ```

3. **Ensure AMP is installed:**
   This script relies on `ampinstmgr`. Please make sure AMP is installed correctly by following the official guide at [cubecoders.com/AMPInstall](https://cubecoders.com/AMPInstall).

4. **Download the Script:**
   Place the `update-amp-script.sh` file in a convenient location, such as `/home/amp/Minecraft/`.

5. **Make the script executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x ./update-amp-script.sh
   ```

---

## 2. Configuration

Open the `update-amp-script.sh` file in a text editor. All configuration is done at the top of the file.

### Server Configuration

* `SPIGOT_VERSION`: Set the Minecraft version you want to build (e.g., "1.21.8").

* `AMP_INSTANCES_ARRAY`: List the exact names of **all** AMP instances you want the script to manage.

* `BUNGEE_INSTANCE_NAME`: The specific name of your BungeeCord instance.

* `SPIGOT_SERVERS_ARRAY`: A list of just your Spigot/Paper server instances (everything except BungeeCord).

### Plugin Control

The script can update the following plugins automatically. You can easily enable or disable updates for each group.

* **General Plugins**: WorldEdit, WorldGuard, ViaVersion, ViaBackwards.

* **EssentialsX**: The full EssentialsX suite.

* **GriefPrevention**: For specific servers.

* **Premium Plugins**: For plugins you upload manually.

To **disable** updates for a group, change its setting from `true` to `false`:

```bash
UPDATE_ESSENTIALSX="false"
UPDATE_GRIEFPREVENTION="false"
UPDATE_PREMIUM_PLUGINS="false"
```

To **disable** updates for an individual plugin like WorldGuard, place a `#` in front of its name in *both* the `MODRINTH_PLUGINS` and `MODRINTH_GLOBS` lists.

### Premium Plugin Workflow

This script uses a secure "dropbox" system for premium plugins.

1. **Download**: When you get an update for a premium plugin, download the new `.jar` from its source.

2. **Upload**: Place the downloaded `.jar` file into the `/home/amp/Minecraft/PremiumPlugins/` folder.

3. **Run the Script**: The script will automatically detect the plugin's name, find which of your servers have it, and perform a safe update. The processed JAR is then moved to an `archived` subfolder.

## 3. Usage

After configuring the script, simply run it from your terminal:

```bash
./update-amp-script.sh
```

The script will provide detailed log messages for each step of the process.
